- NOTE: This challenge is whiteboard only, Write out the code as part of your whiteboard process.

### Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Do all your work in your previous repository `challenges-and-data-structures`
- Create a new branch called `Maximum-Value`
- Solve your challenge and put the image of the solution inside your previously created folder `whiteboard-challenges`
- Update the “Table of Contents” in the README at the root of the repository with a link to this challenge’s README file.

```

## Problem Domain
Write a function called `MaximumValue` that accepts an array of integers as its parameter. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods provided by the language, the function should return the maximum value in the array.

#### Example
```
| Input               | Output |
|---------------------|--------|
| [10, 15, 8, 6, 12]  | 15     |
| [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]     | 9      |
| [7, 9, 13, 25, 5]   | 25     |
```

### Implementation and Testing
- Ensure that each method you write is clean, and well organized. Your code should be modular,You will receive feedback, and marks may be deducted if you attempt to implement a large, complex algorithm within a single function. Each function should have a clear and well-defined purpose.
