## Challenge 04: Insert Value in Middle of Array
- NOTE: This challenge is whiteboard only Write out code as part of your whiteboard process

### Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Do all your work in your previous repository `challenges-and-data-structures`
- Create a new branch called `Insert-Middle-Value`
- Solve your challenge and put the image of the solution inside your previously created folder `whiteboard-challenges`
- Update the “Table of Contents” in the README at the root of the repository with a link to this challenge’s README file.

```
## Problem Domain
Write a function called `MiddleValue` which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Example
```
- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], >5< // 5 is the inserted value
  Output: [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]

- Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], >25<
  Output: [10, 20, 30, 25, 40, 50]

- Input: [7, 14, 21, 28], >10<
  Output: [7, 14, 10, 21, 28]
```

### Implementation and Testing
- Ensure that each method you write is clean and well-organized. Your code should be modular. You will receive feedback, and marks may be deducted if you attempt to implement a large, complex algorithm within a single function. Each function should have a clear and well-defined purpose.
