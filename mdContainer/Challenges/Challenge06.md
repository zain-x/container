## ## Challenge 06: Find Common Elements in Two Arrays
- NOTE: This challenge is a console-based solution, You need to create a console app and submit the `Program.cs` file.

### Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Do all your work in your previous repository `challenges-and-data-structures`
- Create a new branch called `Common-Elements`
- Create a folder `Challenges` inside your repository
- Create another folder inside the `Challenges` folder called `Common-Elements`
- Solve your challenge and put the `Readme.md` and `Program.cs` inside your `Common-Elements` folder
- Provide a screenshot of your console output and put the screenshot inside the Readme.md file
- Update the “Table of Contents” in the README at the root of the repository with a link to this challenge’s README file.

```

## Problem Domain
Write a function called `CommonElements` that accepts two arrays of integers as its parameters. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods provided by the language, the function should return a new array containing the common elements between the two input arrays.

#### Example
```
#### Example
- Input: [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 4, 9]
  Output: [2, 3]

- Input: [79, 8, 15], [23, 79, 8]
  Output: [79, 8]

- Input: [5, 10, 15, 20], [10, 15, 25]
  Output: [10, 15]
```


### Implementation and Testing
- Ensure that each method you write is clean and well-organized. Your code should be modular. You will receive feedback, and marks may be deducted if you attempt to implement a large, complex algorithm within a single function. Each function should have a clear and well-defined purpose.
