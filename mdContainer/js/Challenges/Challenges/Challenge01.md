
## The whiteboard Challenge 
- NOTE: This challenge is whiteboard only Write out code as part of your whiteboard process

### Read all of the following instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository called `challenges-and-data-structures`
- Create a new branch in your for each challenge name
- Make a directory for this challenge called `whiteboard-challenges`, named each whiteboard image according to the challange name.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.

## Example of Table of Contents
```
### Whiteboard Images

### Challenge A: Array Reversal
![Array Reversal Whiteboard](link_to_image)

### Challenge B: Most Frequent Number
![Most Frequent Number Whiteboard](link_to_image)
```

### Challenge A: Array Reversal
Create a function named `ArrayReversal` that accepts an array as its parameter. Without using any built-in methods provided by the C# language, return a new array where the elements are in the reverse order.

#### Example
```
| Input                  | Output              |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]        | [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]     |
| [42, 8, 15, 23, 42]    | [42, 23, 15, 8, 42] |
| [7, 9, 13, 25]         | [25, 13, 9, 7]      |
```

### Challenge B: Most Frequent Number
- Write a method that takes an integer array and returns the number that appears the most times. If there are no duplicates, return the first number in the array. If more than one number shows up the same number of times, return the first found.

```
Input: [1,1,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,5,5,6,7,8,2,1,1]
Output: 1
```
