## Challenge 02: Minimum Value

### Overview

This is a whiteboard-only challenge. Write out the code as part of your whiteboard process.

### Instructions

1. Work in your previous repository: `challenges-and-data-structures`.
2. Create a new branch called `Minimum-Value`.
3. Solve the challenge and include an image of your whiteboard solution in the `whiteboard-challenges` folder.
4. Update the "Table of Contents" in the root README with a link to this challengeâ€™s README file.

### Example Table of Contents Entry

```
### Whiteboard Images
- Challenge 02: Minimum Value
  ![Minimum-Value](link_to_image)
```

### Problem Domain

Write a function called `MinimumValue` that accepts an array of integers. Without using any built-in methods, the function should return the smallest value in the array.

### Example

```
| Input                   | Output |
|---------------------|--------|
| [10, 15, 8, 6, 12]   | 6      |
| [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]        | 1      |
| [7, 9, 13, 25, 5]    | 5      |
```

### Implementation and Testing

- Write clean, modular javascript code.
- Avoid implementing large, complex algorithms in a single function. Instead, break down your solution into smaller functions with specific purposes.

### Submission Instructions

1. Create a branch named `Minimum-Value`.
2. Solve the challenge.
3. Include a `README.md` file with the following:
   - Challenge name.
   - Challenge description.
   - Whiteboard image with your solution.
4. Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
5. Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
6. Merge your branch into the main branch.
7. Submit a link of your GitHub repository with your solutions.
