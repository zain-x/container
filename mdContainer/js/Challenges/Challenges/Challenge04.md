## Challenge 04: Remove Middle Value from Array

### Read all of the following instructions carefully.

- Do all your work in your previous repository `challenges-and-data-structures`
- Create a new branch called `Remove-Middle-Value`
- Solve your challenge and Provide a screenshot of your `console` output and put the screenshot inside the `Readme.md` file ( Or you can run the js file from terminal using: node app.js)
- Update the “Table of Contents” in the README at the root of the repository with a link to this challenge’s README file.

```

## Problem Domain

Write a function called `RemoveMiddleValue` that takes in an array as its parameter. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available in the language, the function should remove the value at the middle index of the array. The function should then return the modified array.

#### Example

- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]

- Input: [27, 8, 15, 73, 27]
  Output: [27, 8, 73, 27]

- Input: [7, 9, 13, 25, 5, 17]
  Output: [7, 9, 13, 5, 17]

### Implementation and Testing

- Ensure that each method you write is clean and well-organized. Your code should be modular. You will receive feedback, and marks may be deducted if you attempt to implement a large, complex algorithm within a single function. Each function should have a clear and well-defined purpose.
