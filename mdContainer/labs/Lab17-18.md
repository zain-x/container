# Lab 18: Bookstore

## Overview

In this lab, you will create a new **Bookstore Management** platform using the MVC architecture. This includes implementing Models, Views, and Controllers for handling CRUD operations for books.

- By the end of this lab, you’ll:

1. Build a full MVC-based ASP.NET Core project.
2. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing books.
3. Use Entity Framework Core for data management and SQL Server for database storage.
4. Implement forms with validation for book creation and editing.

## Application Setup

1. Create a new `ASP.NET Core MVC Web App` project for the Bookstore platform.
2. Set up your database connection using SQL Server.
3. From NuGet Manager add the following packages:

```csharp
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
```

## Tasks

1. **Create the Book Model**

   - Define the **Book** model to represent books in the system.
   - Include properties Title, Author, Price, Genre.
   - Apply necessary validation attributes like `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, and `[Range]` to ensure proper data validation.

2. **Set Up the Database Context**

   - Create a database context to manage books in the application.
   - Register the database context in your application’s service configuration.

3. **Create the BooksController**

   - Implement a controller to handle the main CRUD operations for books.
     - **Index**: Display a list of books.
     - **Create**: Add new books.
     - **Edit**: Update existing books.
     - **Delete**: Remove books.
     - **Details**: View detailed information about a specific book.

4. **Create the Views**

   - Implement Razor views for each of the CRUD actions:
   - Index, Create, Edit, Delete, and Details views.
   - For the `Create` and `Edit` views, implement forms with validation using `asp-for` for model binding, validation summaries, and error messages.
   - Ensure that validation errors are displayed when required fields are missing or invalid inputs are provided

5. **CRUD Operations**

- Implement CRUD operations using Entity Framework Core.
- Ensure that data is persisted in the database.

## Stretch goal:

- Add a search feature to the `Index` page to allow users to filter books by title or author.

## README

- Your **README.md** file should include:
- Instructions on setting up the Bookstore MVC project.
- Details on how to run the application and use the CRUD functionality.

## How To Submit this Lab

2. Complete the lab tasks as per the requirements above.
3. Update the `README.md` file with the necessary content.
4. Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
5. Create a pull request from the `Bookstore` branch to the main branch.
6. Submit a link to your pull request in the submission field.
